# AWS CloudSec Microservices Platform

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive cloud-native microservices platform fully deployed on AWS, showcasing expertise in cloud engineering, software development, and security. The platform incorporates advanced AWS services, configuration management, containerization, orchestration, and robust security measures, including secrets management via HashiCorp Vault.

## Architecture
The AWS CloudSec Microservices Platform consists of the following key components:

### Microservices Architecture
- **API Gateway**: Routes incoming requests to individual microservices
- **Authentication Service**: Implements user management and JWT-based authentication using AWS Cognito
- **Core Business Service**: Handles main application logic
- **Frontend Service**: Provides a responsive UI using modern frameworks

### Security Implementation
- **HashiCorp Vault**: Manages secrets and sensitive information
- **Encryption**: TLS/SSL for all communications using AWS Certificate Manager
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained access control with AWS IAM roles and policies
- **Network Security**: AWS VPC, Security Groups, and Network ACLs

### Infrastructure & Configuration Management
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for provisioning AWS resources
- **Configuration Management**: Automated setup and configuration

### Containerization & Orchestration
- **Docker**: Containerization of microservices
- **Kubernetes on EKS**: Orchestration with auto-scaling and self-healing

### CI/CD and DevOps
- **Automated Pipeline**: AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild
- **Deployment Strategies**: Blue/green or canary deployments

### Observability and Monitoring
- **Monitoring & Logging**: AWS CloudWatch, Prometheus, and Grafana
- **Alerting**: CloudWatch alarms and SNS notifications
