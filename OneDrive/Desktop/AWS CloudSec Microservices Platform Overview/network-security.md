# Network Security Implementation for AWS CloudSec Microservices Platform

This document outlines the network security implementation for the AWS CloudSec Microservices Platform, focusing on VPC configuration, security groups, network ACLs, and other security measures.

## VPC Architecture

Our VPC architecture follows the principle of defense in depth with multiple layers of security:

### Subnet Segmentation
- **Public Subnets**: Only contain load balancers and bastion hosts
- **Private Application Subnets**: Contain EKS nodes and application services
- **Private Data Subnets**: Contain databases, caches, and other data services

### Network Flow
1. All external traffic enters through public subnets via load balancers or API Gateway
2. Traffic is then routed to services in private application subnets
3. Application services communicate with data services in private data subnets
4. No direct path exists from public internet to private subnets

## Security Groups Configuration

Security groups are configured following the principle of least privilege:

### Load Balancer Security Group
- Allows inbound HTTP/HTTPS (ports 80/443) from the internet
- Allows outbound traffic only to EKS node security group

### EKS Cluster Security Group
- Allows inbound traffic from EKS node security group
- Allows outbound traffic to EKS node security group

### EKS Node Security Group
- Allows inbound traffic from load balancer security group and EKS cluster security group
- Allows inbound traffic from other EKS nodes for pod-to-pod communication
- Allows outbound traffic to database, cache, and Vault security groups

### Database Security Group
- Allows inbound traffic only from EKS node security group on specific database ports
- No outbound internet access

### ElastiCache Security Group
- Allows inbound traffic only from EKS node security group on Redis port (6379)
- No outbound internet access

### Vault Security Group
- Allows inbound traffic only from EKS node security group on Vault port (8200)
- No outbound internet access

## Network ACLs

Network ACLs provide an additional layer of security at the subnet level:

### Public Subnet NACLs
- Inbound: Allow HTTP/HTTPS, deny all other traffic
- Outbound: Allow responses to established connections, deny all other traffic

### Private Application Subnet NACLs
- Inbound: Allow traffic from public subnets and other private subnets, deny all other traffic
- Outbound: Allow traffic to other private subnets and responses to public subnets, deny internet access

### Private Data Subnet NACLs
- Inbound: Allow traffic only from private application subnets on specific ports
- Outbound: Allow responses to private application subnets, deny all other traffic

## VPC Endpoints

VPC endpoints are used to securely connect to AWS services without traversing the public internet:

- S3 Gateway Endpoint: For secure access to S3 buckets
- DynamoDB Gateway Endpoint: For secure access to DynamoDB tables
- Interface Endpoints for:
  - ECR (container registry)
  - CloudWatch (logs and metrics)
  - STS (security token service)
  - SSM (systems manager)

## VPC Flow Logs

VPC Flow Logs are enabled to capture information about IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in the VPC:

- Flow logs are stored in CloudWatch Logs
- Log retention period: 30 days
- Logs are used for:
  - Network monitoring
  - Troubleshooting
  - Security analysis
  - Compliance auditing

## Additional Security Measures

### AWS Shield and WAF
- AWS Shield Standard is enabled for DDoS protection
- AWS WAF is configured with rules to protect against:
  - SQL injection
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS)
  - Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
  - Geographic restrictions based on business requirements

### TLS/SSL Encryption
- All external communications use TLS 1.2+
- Internal service-to-service communication is encrypted
- Certificate management through AWS Certificate Manager

### Bastion Host
- Secure bastion host for administrative access
- Multi-factor authentication required
- Limited SSH access with key-based authentication only
- Session logging and monitoring

## Network Security Monitoring

- CloudWatch alarms for suspicious network activity
- GuardDuty for threat detection
- Security Hub for security posture management
- Automated remediation for common security issues

## Network Security Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Services can only communicate with other services they explicitly need to interact with
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Encryption in Transit**: All network traffic is encrypted
4. **Regular Security Audits**: Network configuration is regularly audited
5. **Automated Compliance Checks**: AWS Config rules ensure compliance with security standards
