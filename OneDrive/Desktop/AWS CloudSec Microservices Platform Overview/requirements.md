- Set up CI/CD for infrastructure changes
- Implement proper tagging strategy for resources

### Configuration Management
- Implement Ansible for configuration management
- Create playbooks for EC2 instance configuration
- Set up roles and tasks for different service types
- Implement idempotent configuration
- Configure secrets integration with Vault
- Set up configuration validation and testing

## 4. Containerization & Orchestration on AWS

### Containerization
- Containerize each microservice using Docker
- Create optimized Dockerfiles following best practices
- Implement multi-stage builds for smaller images
- Configure proper base images with security in mind
- Set up container scanning in the build process
- Implement proper tagging strategy for container images
- Configure ECR repositories for image storage

### Orchestration
- Deploy containerized applications on AWS EKS
- Configure Kubernetes namespaces for service isolation
- Set up deployments with proper resource limits
- Implement horizontal pod autoscaling
- Configure liveness and readiness probes
- Set up service discovery and load balancing
- Implement rolling updates and rollback strategies
- Configure persistent storage where needed
- Implement network policies for pod-to-pod communication

## 5. CI/CD and DevOps

### Pipeline
- Build automated CI/CD pipeline with AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild
- Implement source code integration with CodeCommit or GitHub
- Configure build specifications for each microservice
- Set up unit and integration testing in the pipeline
- Implement security scanning for code and containers
- Configure artifact storage and versioning
- Implement approval gates for production deployments

### Deployment Strategies
- Implement blue/green deployment using AWS CodeDeploy
- Configure canary deployments for gradual rollout
- Set up traffic shifting mechanisms
- Implement automated rollback on failure
- Configure deployment hooks for validation

## 6. Observability and Monitoring

### Monitoring & Logging
- Integrate AWS CloudWatch for metrics and logging
- Configure custom metrics for business KPIs
- Set up log groups and retention policies
