## Development Workflow

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies for the microservice you're working on
3. Set up local environment variables (see `.env.example` files)
4. Run the service using npm scripts
5. Use Docker Compose for multi-service development:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
   ```

### Code Standards

- ESLint for JavaScript linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- Jest for unit testing
- Follow the existing code structure and patterns

### Git Workflow

1. Create feature branches from `develop`
2. Follow conventional commits format
3. Submit pull requests for review
4. Squash and merge to `develop`
5. Release from `develop` to `main`

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for service interactions
- Security tests for vulnerability detection
- Load tests for performance validation

## Deployment Process

The platform uses a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment. For detailed deployment instructions, refer to the [Deployment Guide](deployment-guide.md).

### Deployment Environments

1. **Development**
   - Purpose: Active development and testing
   - Deployment: Manual or triggered by PR
   - Configuration: Minimal resources, debug enabled

2. **Staging**
   - Purpose: Pre-production validation
   - Deployment: Automated from `develop` branch
   - Configuration: Production-like with test data

3. **Production**
   - Purpose: Live environment
   - Deployment: Automated from `main` branch
   - Configuration: Full resources, optimized for performance

### Deployment Strategy

The platform uses a blue/green deployment strategy:

1. New version is deployed alongside the existing version
2. Tests are run against the new version
3. Traffic is gradually shifted to the new version
4. Old version is maintained until the new version is stable
5. Old version is decommissioned after successful deployment
