## Data Flow

1. Client requests enter the system through CloudFront or API Gateway
2. API Gateway routes requests to appropriate microservices
3. Authentication Service validates user identity and permissions
4. Core Business Service processes business logic and data
5. Data is stored in appropriate data stores (RDS, DynamoDB, S3)
6. Responses are returned to clients through API Gateway

## Security Architecture

The security architecture follows a defense-in-depth approach:

1. **Edge Security**:
   - DDoS protection with AWS Shield
   - Web application firewall with AWS WAF
   - TLS encryption for all communications

2. **Network Security**:
   - VPC isolation with public and private subnets
   - Security groups for instance-level firewall
   - Network ACLs for subnet-level security
   - VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring

3. **Identity Security**:
   - AWS IAM for service-level access control
   - Cognito for user authentication
   - JWT tokens for session management
   - MFA for critical operations

4. **Data Security**:
   - Encryption at rest with KMS
   - Encryption in transit with TLS
   - Data classification and handling policies
   - Secure data deletion procedures

5. **Application Security**:
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Output encoding
   - CSRF protection
   - Content Security Policy

6. **Secrets Management**:
   - HashiCorp Vault for secrets storage
   - Dynamic secret generation
   - Secret rotation
   - Audit logging for secret access

## Deployment Architecture

The platform uses a multi-environment deployment strategy:

1. **Development Environment**:
   - Used for active development
   - Simplified infrastructure
   - Shared resources where appropriate

2. **Staging Environment**:
   - Mirror of production
   - Used for testing and validation
   - Isolated from production data

3. **Production Environment**:
   - Fully redundant and highly available
   - Multi-AZ deployment
   - Auto-scaling for all components
   - Enhanced security controls

## Scalability and Resilience

The architecture is designed for horizontal scalability and resilience:

1. **Scalability**:
   - Stateless microservices for horizontal scaling
   - Auto-scaling groups for dynamic capacity
   - Database read replicas for read scaling
   - Caching for performance optimization

2. **Resilience**:
   - Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
   - Kubernetes self-healing for container failures
   - Circuit breakers for service isolation
   - Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - Graceful degradation for non-critical services

## Observability Architecture

The platform implements comprehensive observability:

1. **Metrics**:
   - Infrastructure metrics with CloudWatch
   - Application metrics with Prometheus
   - Business metrics for KPIs

2. **Logging**:
   - Centralized logging with CloudWatch Logs
   - Structured logging format
   - Log correlation with request IDs

3. **Tracing**:
   - Distributed tracing with X-Ray
   - Service dependency mapping
   - Performance bottleneck identification

4. **Alerting**:
   - CloudWatch Alarms for threshold-based alerts
   - Anomaly detection for unusual patterns
   - Alert routing and escalation

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

The CI/CD pipeline automates the software delivery process:

1. **Source Control**:

   - Environment promotion workflow

## Disaster Recovery

The disaster recovery strategy ensures business continuity:

1. **Backup and Restore**:
   - Automated database backups
   - Point-in-time recovery
   - S3 versioning for object recovery

2. **Failover**:
   - Multi-AZ deployment for regional failures
   - Cross-region replication for critical data
   - DNS failover with Route 53

3. **Recovery Procedures**:
