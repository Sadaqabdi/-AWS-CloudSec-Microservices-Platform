   ```bash
   aws eks update-nodegroup-config \
     --cluster-name cloudsec-eks-cluster \
     --nodegroup-name standard-workers \
     --scaling-config desiredSize=X,minSize=Y,maxSize=Z
   ```

4. Restore from backup to that point
5. Verify data integrity
6. Resume operations
7. Analyze root cause
8. Implement preventive measures

### DR Testing

1. Schedule quarterly DR tests
2. Define test scenarios
3. Document test procedures
